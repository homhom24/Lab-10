# Hello Keith!

This is my submission for lab 10. I used one of the sprites (which was difficulties because of the weird naming issue with assets) from the p5.play library.
I created a little sprite named "Bubs". ðŸ¦„

Lab 10: Processing on the Web

I worked on this lab by myself with some help from the tutor Arnav.
He helped me move everything on glitch and figure out how to get the sprites to
show up initially. There was an issue with the actual name of the files in the assets
folder since what was shown didn't actually pull up the image. It had to be clicked
on to see the actual title. I'm planning to use sprites (of my own creation) in my final
project so this was pretty informative for me.
